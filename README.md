# CustomJekyll
The purpose of this gem is to make one's life easy while making any kind of site with jekyll. This gem is a mere generator that will generate all the files required for you to start any kind of static website using jekyll. Jekyll default generator is focused for blogs. I love to make different static websites and hosting them using github pages. 

Generate using CustomJekyll and have the basic structure for creating any kind of static website and then hosting it on GithubPages.
    

## Usage
### Install
```shell
$ gem install custom_jekyll
```
### Generate a site
```shell
$ custom_jekyll static-is-fun-with-jekyll
```
### if you do not like the name custom_jekyll (I totally understand :P)
Add the following in your shell's profile

```shell
alias cj="custom_jekyll"
```
